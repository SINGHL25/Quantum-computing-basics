- **Qubits**: quantum bits that can be in superposition.
- **Superposition**: linear combination of |0⟩ and |1⟩.
- **Entanglement**: non-classical correlation between qubits.
- **Measurement**: collapses state to classical outcome.
- **Circuits**: sequences of gates applied to qubits.

Try: run `python main.py --demo qubit` and inspect `results/plots/measurement_histogram.png`.
